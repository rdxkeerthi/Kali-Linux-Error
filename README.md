In my case the name of the partition is nvme0n1p2. Donâ€™t forget to add the -y to avoid typing it multiple times. If you have multiple partitions ext2 or ext4 type you can run this for each one.

```fsck /dev/nvme0n1p2 -y```

When it finishes you can just reboot and that will take you to the login screen as usual.

```reboot -f```
